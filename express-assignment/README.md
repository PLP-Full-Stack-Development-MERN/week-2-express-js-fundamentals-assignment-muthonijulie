To set up the project:
1.Clone the repository and create the express-assignment folder.
Check if you have node and npm:npm --v,node --v.If you do not have npm or node, follow the right procedures to install them depending on your operating system.
Initialize the node.js project then install express to the project.

Install dotenv and ensure the environment variables are written.
Install nodemon and test it by running 'npm start'.
Set up the mongoDB connection in the models folder and ensure that it is connected to the mongoDb on the terminal.

To test the project:
Once the routes and the necessary logics have been written, go tou your API endpoints to test the routes. In my case i used Insomnia.
Test each route using the CRUD functionality and if they work appropriately then you project is well verified.
Check your database to ensure that data has been recorded on the database.

Testing of all routes on my endpoint has been successfull.
